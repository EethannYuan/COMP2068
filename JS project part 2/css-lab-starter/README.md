# CSS Lab Starter
This is a starter project for the 'HTML and CSS Review Part 2' lab.
It contains:
- index.html, about.html, services.html, contact.html
- css/style.css (with question-numbered comments and TODOs)
- assets/ (images and media folders are present for you to add files)

**Important**: This is a skeleton to guide your work. Do not submit this as-is.
Fill content, replace placeholder images, pick one background image from the module, validate HTML, and add your name in the footer.
